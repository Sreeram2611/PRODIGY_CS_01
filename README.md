This Python script implements the **Caesar Cipher** — a simple encryption algorithm that shifts each letter in the message by a user-defined value.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Encrypt and decrypt messages
- 🎛️ Interactive user prompts
- 🔡 Case preserved, non-letters unchanged

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Caesar Cipher logic and modular arithmetic
- ASCII character manipulation in Python
- Writing clean, interactive CLI programs

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
Choose e to encrypt or d to decrypt

Enter your message and shift value

See the result in the terminal

💬 Example
```pgsql
Enter 'e' or 'd': e  
Message: Hello, World!  
Shift: 3  
Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!
